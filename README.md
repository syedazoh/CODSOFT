# Startup Simulator - Multi-Agent AI-powered Business Simulation Platform

## Project Overview

Startup Simulator is a comprehensive multi-agent AI-powered business simulation platform designed to model complex business operations through autonomous agents managing different departments of a startup.

## Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI - Python)

The backend consists of four autonomous agents:

1. **Finance Agent** - Manages budgets, revenue tracking, expense management
2. **Marketing Agent** - Handles campaigns, market analysis, customer engagement  
3. **HR Agent** - Manages recruitment, payroll, team performance
4. **Operations Agent** - Oversees supply chain, resource allocation, process optimization

### Key Components

- **Event Bus**: Central messaging system for agent communication
- **Agent Manager**: Orchestrates multiple agents and their interactions
- **FastAPI**: RESTful API for frontend communication

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- Modern React UI with Tailwind CSS styling
- Redux state management
- Real-time API integration with axios
- Responsive dashboard

### DevOps

- Docker containerization (Backend, Frontend)
- Docker Compose for local development
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for caching
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
